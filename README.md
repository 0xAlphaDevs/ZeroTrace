## Generate verifier contract

### Contract

The deployment assumes a verifier contract has been generated by nargo. In order to do this, run:

```bash
cd circuits
nargo codegen-verifier
```

A file named `plonk_vk.sol` should appear in the `circuits/contracts/with_foundry` folder.

### Test locally

1. Copy `vite-hardhat/.env.example` to a new file `vite-hardhat/.env`.

2. Start a local development EVM at <http://localhost:8545> with

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

   or if foundry is preferred, with

   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

3. Run the [example test file](./test/index.test.ts) with

   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

The test demonstrates basic usage of Noir in a TypeScript Node.js environment.

### Deploy locally

1. Copy `vite-hardhat/.env.example` to a new file `vite-hardhat/.env`.

2. Start a local development EVM at <http://localhost:8545> with

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

   or if foundry is preferred, with

   ```bash
   anvil
   ```

3. Build the project and deploy contracts to the local development chain with

   ```bash
   NETWORK=localhost yarn build
   ```

   > **Note:** If the deployment fails, try removing `yarn.lock` and reinstalling dependencies with
   > `yarn`.

4. Once your contracts are deployed and the build is finished, you can preview the built website
   with

   ```bash
   yarn preview
   ```

### Deploy on networks

You can choose any other network in `hardhat.config.ts` and deploy there using this `NETWORK`
environment variable.

For example, `NETWORK=mumbai yarn build` or `NETWORK=sepolia yarn build`.

Make sure you:

- Update the deployer private keys in `vite-hardhat/.env`
- Have funds in the deployer account
- Add keys for alchemy (to act as a node) in `vite-hardhat/.env`
